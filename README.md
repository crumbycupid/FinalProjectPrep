## Cooperation Plan
Strengths:
Sharmarke: Being empathic Ryan: CSS Adrian: Communication Devon: Research, Design, Tech Writing
We can best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project by working as a team and utilizing each others strengths to accomplish and finish our midterm gracefully.
Professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength:
Sharmarke: Technical writing Ryan: Process Adrian: Tool Proficiency  Devon: Technical writing
We plan to approach the day-to-day work by communicating what we want to accomplish.
## Conflict Plan
Our group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises will be to communicate with one another to solve conflicts.
If one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, we  will have a meeting as a group and have a conversation on that conflict. We will attempt to solve everything within the group first.
Seeing each others commits to see and have morning meeting do discuss problems and work together if the problem arises, is how we would approach those concerns.
We will raise those concerns through slack or our morning meetings is how we would raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing.
Having a 3 strike rule, then have a conversation with Alex and Rey about it once it reaches the 3rd strike.
## Communication Plan
From 9 am - 6 pm and possibly after hours.
The platform we will be using is Zoom and Slack for communication and Github project management for tracking progress.
One break every hour, one hour break at lunch.
Working after hours if we fall behind.
We will be communicating after hours through Slack.
The strategy to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard is by having honest feedback on how everyone is doing.
We will ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being empathetic on each other and also make sure we are all on the same page.
## Work Plan
Communicate in Slack, Remo, Zoom, and a GitHub project tool on what task we split into doing and have a discussion where we are, when we are stuck, and when we are complete.
Github will be used is the project management tool.

## Git Process
HTML, Java, AWS, Android Studio, and CSS will the be components on Github.
We are all collaborators so we will have copies of the repos.
The Git flow will be everything on the staging branch with a new name and then each day have one branch for a specific implementation that would be merged into the staging branch.
Everyone will review staging into main. We won't merge our own code. We will push to a branch and wait for 2 approvers. At the end of the day we will merge into the staging branch. Communicate in zoom and slack when it is time to merge.
